# webpage_recreate

Recreating websites with HTML and CSS. Purely for practice purposes.

Note: while I use dev tools built into Firefox and Chrome for my recreated pages, I do not use dev tools on the original websites. All layout was eyeballed by me. Images are primarily screengrabs by me from their respective websites.
